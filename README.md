Projects

**DonateMate **
This website was built for our final group project over 7 days.  The pupose of the site was to have a site that donars could search organisations and understand what goods they were urgently needing.  It also allowed orgganisatons to create a profile to let the doners know what they were needing.  I supported with setting up Auth0 and implementing some of the components for viewing an organisation.
I played the joint role of agile facilitator with a colleague to guide converrsations, iddentify roadblocks and ensure we were were able to deliver our Minimum Loveable Product (MLP).  


**Skills**
I currently developing my skills in Javascript, Typescript, React,RESTful API's, HML and CSS through a personal project I am working on.  I am also registered on some free courses so I can continue to upskill and learn while working.


Iâ€™m eager to connect with fellow professionals in the software development realm. If you know of any opportunities or have connections in the industry, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
